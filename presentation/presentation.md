# presentation

This is the presentation for the TBRe Localisation and Mapping team.

## information

- An overview of what algorithms are used for localization, SLAM, and data association
(the process of determining whether a newly observed cone has been observed previously)

- A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms
(keeping localization, SLAM and data association all separate of course)
