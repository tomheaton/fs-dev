# SLAM notes

## Introduction

SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping) is the computational problem
of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously
keeping track of an agent's location within it.

Popular methods used to solve this problem:
- particle filter
- extended Kalman filter
- covariance intersection
- GraphSLAM

SLAM algorithms are bases on concepts in computational geometry and computer vision

They are aimed to use the available resources to the best of its ability,
rather than to a perfect solution.
